## PR Description (copy-paste and fill in)

### Why these changes are being made

[Explain the purpose / intent in 3–6 sentences]  
The original README assumed readers already knew the sprint context and project structure. It lacked clear onboarding instructions, references to sprint artefacts, and a defined contribution process using Pull Requests.  

These changes evolve the README into a proper **onboarding-focused document** as required by **Assignment 4.2 Part A**, improving clarity for new developers/trainees, reducing ramp-up time, and demonstrating professional documentation practices.

### Main changes introduced

- [ ] Project overview explaining what the system does and who it is for  
- [ ] System context describing major components at a high level  
- [ ] Onboarding guidance including prerequisites and how to get started  
- [ ] Explanation of key folders and markdown artefacts (especially in `docs/`)  
- [ ] Contribution workflow describing how Pull Requests are used  
- [ ] Placeholders for future technical sections (API docs, Docker, deployment, etc.)  
- [ ] Other: _______________________________

### What reviewers should focus on

Please pay special attention to these points to help confirm the PR meets Assignment 4.2 requirements:

- Does the **project overview** clearly state the system's purpose and target audience?
- Is the **system context** high-level, accurate, and appropriate for the current documentation stage?
- Are the **onboarding steps** (prerequisites + quick start) realistic and easy to follow?
- Do the explanations of **key folders and artefacts** correctly reference our sprint files (`user-stories.md`, `epics.md`, `priority-matrix.md`, `estimation.md`, `sprint-1-review.md`)?
- Is the **contribution workflow** well described, realistic, and emphasizes Pull Requests as communication artefacts?
- Are there useful **placeholders** for upcoming sections?
- Overall clarity, formatting, professionalism, and alignment with lecturer's style/structure
