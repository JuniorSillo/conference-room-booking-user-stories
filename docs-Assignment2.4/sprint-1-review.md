# Sprint 1 Review

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Sprint Goal:** Enable employees to book and manage conference rooms efficiently (including recurring bookings, cancellations, and equipment requirements), while providing admins with basic monitoring and conflict resolution tools.

## Sprint Goal Outcome
**Partially Met**  
Core employee booking flow is fully usable. Admin dashboard is basic but not complete. Recurring and conflict tools are partial.

| Story # | Reason                                                                 | Decision (Carry / Split / Drop) |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 6       | Advanced UI dashboard features (interactive charts, date filtering, responsive layout) and backend endpoints (aggregated data/time-zones) took longer | Carry over(on Sprint 2)                      |

## Stakeholder Feedback
- **Positive feedback:** Core booking, cancellation, and equipment filtering work smoothly and feel usable to the users and it is a great foundation for employees.
- **Concerns or questions:** Why was the Admin Dashboard not yet done, Story Goal not clearly explained?
- **Requests or adjustments:** Prioritize finishing dashboard interactivity and recurring conflict handling in Sprint 2 and consider writing crystal clear points when explaining the work.
