**Executive Summary (3 sentences):**  
Sprint 1 delivered a solid core booking system for employees (full booking, cancellation, equipment filtering) but fell short on advanced admin features due to underestimated UI and endpoint complexity. We completed 13 of 20 committed points, partially meeting the goal of efficient booking and basic monitoring. Key lesson: Break complex UI/backend stories smaller and spike risks early.

**Key accomplishments:**  
- Fully usable booking flow (#1, #3, #4, #8 ) — employees can book/cancel/filter equipment today.  
- Basic dashboard skeleton and occupancy chart (#6 partial).  

**Challenges faced:**  
- Underestimated advanced dashboard UI (interactive charts, responsive layout) and backend endpoints (aggregations, time-zones).  
- Unorganised Development team(based on roles)  

**Process improvements identified:**  
- Smaller sub-tasks from planning.  
- Early spikes on risky areas.  
- Lower velocity target (15–18 pts) for Sprint 2.  

**Velocity and burndown chart (ASCII description):**  
Planned velocity: 20 pts  
Actual: 13 pts (65% complete)  
Burndown: Started at 20 → steady drop Week 1 (core stories) → plateau Week 2 (dashboard/recurring stuck) → ended at 13 remaining.
