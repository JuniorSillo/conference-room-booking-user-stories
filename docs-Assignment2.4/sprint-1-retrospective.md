# Sprint 1 Retrospective

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Participants:** Junior Sillo(Backend), Andile Masoka(Frontend) and Thembinkosi (Software Testing)

## Start
- Early spikes/prototypes on complex areas (Chart.js interactivity, time-zone queries)  
- Daily quick syncs  
- Break stories into smallersub-tasks from Day 1

## Stop
- Underestimating UI polish and backend aggregation time  
- Starting dependent stories too early without full dependency completion  
- Working long hours without time-boxing led to fatigue

## Continue
- Strict focus on high-priority core stories first (#1, #4, #5)  
- Using sub-tasks for granular daily progress  
- Adding dated comments in Asana to track execution
