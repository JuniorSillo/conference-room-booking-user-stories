# Sprint 1 — Personal Reflection

## Key Learning
The most important lesson was how work actually flows in a sprint: nothing is linear. Dependencies block progress(Let's say if Story #1, which was building the booking system was not done meaning we can't jump to another stories), complexity hides in "simple" UI/backend tasks (like Chart.js interactivity and time-zone queries), and solo work amplifies planning errors. Stories don't finish in 1–2 days. They need sub-tasks over multiple days to stay visible and realistic.

## Assumptions That Failed
My biggest failed assumption was estimation, I thought advanced dashboard features (interactive charts, responsive layout, date filtering) and backend aggregations would take 2–3 days, but they needed 5+ due to polish and edge cases. I also assumed shared Asana would be seamless, but limited control slowed setup.

## Behavioural Change
Always provide clear Sprint Gaols. And Also In Sprint 2, I will change one concrete behaviour: always create 5–8 sub-tasks per story during planning (not after). This forces early breakdown, reveals hidden complexity, and lets me track daily task progress instead of big story leaps.

## Professional Growth
The skill I need to strengthen is **risk anticipation and time-boxing**. In a real Scrum team, I'd focus on early spikes/prototypes for risky areas (UI polish, complex queries) and strict time-boxes to avoid scope creep. This sprint taught me that over-optimism kills velocity, better to under-commit and over-deliver than the reverse. Overall, this first sprint showed me Scrum isn't just ceremonies. It's about honest reflection, small wins, and constant adaptation. I'm excited for Sprint 2 with better planning and sub-task discipline.
