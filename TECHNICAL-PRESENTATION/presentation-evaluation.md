# Presentation Self-Evaluation

**Clarity of explanation**  
Strong – Used simple language, avoided jargon overload, focused on why things matter for onboarding.

**Technical accuracy**  
High – All details match the project (API spec, Docker, Postman mock, Git flow). No errors in architecture or pitfalls.

**Structure and flow**  
Excellent – Exactly 10 slides as required, logical progression from problem → solution → how-to → risks → demo.

**Confidence in delivery**  
Would be high with practice – Notes are conversational, timings realistic, Q&A anticipated.

**What I would improve next time**  
- Add one more visual diagram, if time allows.  
- Record a practice run to time it perfectly under 7 min.  
- Include a quick live terminal clip if recording was allowed.
- Make sure I have Docker installed.
