# Documentation & Collaboration Reflection

**Original README assumptions**
The original README (main branch) presumed that the reader already knew the context of the sprint. It likely just listed tech stack or had minimal setup. It presumed audience members who created it, not new developers who would be joining the project.

**What's changed in the updated README file**
The new version begins with the purpose and audience, introduces high-level context, outlines numbered steps for setup, describes folders & sprint artifacts, and describes the contribution process. The new developer is able to clone, run, and understand the project structure in under 15 minutes compared to asking many questions or searching through scattered markdown files.

**Learned about communication through PRs and issues**
Pull Requests are far more than code drops, they are communication tools. Writing a good description of a PR forces you to think about *why* you are doing the change, what trade-offs were made, and what specifically the reviewers need to look at. Likewise, issue templates (bug and feature) cut down noise significantly rather than generic “it’s broken” reports, and reporters include steps to reproduce, environment details, and context. This helps resolve issues faster and with better quality.

In general, this assignment has taught me that good documentation & workflows aren’t something extra that you have to do, but rather something that prevents a lot of work down the line.
