# Documentation & Collaboration Reflection

**Original README assumptions**  
The original README (in the main branch) assumed the reader was already familiar with the sprint context. It probably just listed tech stack or had minimal setup. It assumed audience team members who built it, not new developers joining later.

**How the updated README improves onboarding**  
The new version starts with purpose and audience, gives high-level context, provides numbered setup steps, explains folders & sprint artefacts, and clearly states the contribution process. A new developer can now clone, run, and understand the project structure in under 15 minutes instead of needing to ask many questions or dig through scattered markdown files.

**Learned about communication through PRs and issues**  
Pull Requests are much more than code delivery, they are structured communication artefacts. A good PR description forces you to articulate *why* you're making changes, what trade-offs were considered, and what exactly reviewers should check. This reduces misunderstandings and makes reviews faster/more focused.  
Similarly, standardized issue templates (bug and feature) dramatically reduce noise instead of vague "it's broken" messages, reporters provide reproduction steps, environment info, and context upfront. This saves everyone time and leads to faster, higher-quality resolutions.

Overall, this assignment showed me that good documentation & workflows aren't extra work, they prevent far more work later through clearer, more professional collaboration.
