# Sprint 1 Mid-Sprint Checkpoint
**Date:** 22 January 2026 (Day 7)

## Progress Snapshot
- Planned points: 20  
- Completed points: 5 (Story #1 and Story #4)  
- In progress: 8 (Story #5: 3, Story #6: 5 = partially done)  
- Not started: 7 (Story #2: 5, Story #9: 2)  
- **Status:** Slightly at risk (behind by ~3–5 points)

## At-Risk Work
- Story #6 Admin Dashboard – charts taking longer than expected  
- Story #2 Recurring Bookings – complexity of series conflict handling underestimated

## Decisions Taken
- Deferred advanced dashboard filters (date range, user search) to Sprint 2  
- Reduced scope of Story #6 charts from 4 types to 2 (occupancy and booking trend)  
- Accepted that Story #2 may only be 70–80% complete by end of sprint

## Blockers
- Resolved: Timezone bug in Story #1 (fixed with moment-timezone)  
- Outstanding: None at checkpoint

## Team Health
Collaboration: As a Solo developer, feeling focused but noticing fatigue after long days.  
Morale: Good.
