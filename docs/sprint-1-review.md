# Sprint 1 Review
**Date:** 30 January 2026

## Sprint Goal Outcome
**Partially met**
Booking and Cancellation work great. Recurring and dashboard delivered partially.
Employees can book,cancel,manage basic needs. Admin have basic visibility bvut not full conflict tools.

|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1       | Yes – all criteria                                              | Core booking fully working         |

| 6       | Partially – basic list & 2 charts, no advanced filters          | Deferred filters to Sprint 2       |
| 2       | Partially – recurring creation works, partial conflict handling | Series editing needs more work     |
