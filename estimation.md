## Velocity & Estimation Reasoning

### Total story points: 1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3+5+5 = 33 points (adding up the points from the stories: 3+5+2+2+3+5+3+3+2+5=33).
Assuming a realistic team velocity of 10-15 points per sprint (based on a small team of 4-6 developers, accounting for planning, testing, and unexpected issues in an Agile setup—common for mid-sized projects like this). I'd propose 12 points per sprint as a balanced estimate: It allows for quality without rushing, considering dependencies (e.g., basic booking before cancellations).
With 33 points total, this would take about 3 sprints:
- Sprint 1: 12 points
- Sprint 2: 12 points
- Sprint 3: 9 points
Reasoning: Prioritize high-value, low-complexity stories first (like basic booking and dashboard) to deliver core functionality early. Dependencies (Story #1) dictate sequencing. This leaves buffer for refinements or bugs, aligning with Agile's iterative nature.
